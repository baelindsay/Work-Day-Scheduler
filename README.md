# Work Day Scheduler 
Coding BootCamp: 5th Module Challange

# Deployed Application //link add here

## Description
A clean and simple 9-5 hourly work day scheduler with adorable paw icon save buttons. 


# Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist

# Results
I learned that the Date Object is to be feared and I am grateful that other brilliant humans were able to compile and code the data library prior the start of my coding journey. 
I also solidified my knowledge on local storage through this project as well!
